# Anne's Cookbook - Her Uzbek Recipes Online
Anne's Cookbook is a beloved online platform that allows me and my six older sisters to stay connected with our cultural roots by sharing and preserving our mother's homemade Uzbek recipes. This app enables us to access our family recipes from anywhere, anytime, and helps us keep our cultural food traditions alive. Our mother's recipes play a significant role in keeping our family traditions alive. I hope that [my app](https://online-cookbook.herokuapp.com/) will help us continue to share our cultural food traditions with our future generations!
